# EkilitFucker
EKilitFucker (as the harsh name suggests) is an app that uninstalls E-Kilit without any trace it ever existed.
it can detect the install path and the alias name automatically.

## What the hell even is E-Kilit?
E-Kilit is a software made by (MehCan)[https://mehcan.net/] designed to "prolong the usage lifespan" of those big-ass touch screen boards in schools by protecting them from "unauthorized access by students" and provides a "secure internet browsing experience" through a "controlled list of websites". Additionally, it offers remote control capabilities, enabling fat school personnel to connect to the boards from their computers and "spy them effectively."

## How the fuck does this work??
1. find the service that has the description "Sound Normalization Service" (bad design choices man)
2. query the ImagePath (aka install location) of the so-called service.
3. disable auto-start of the service.
4. disable UAC temporarily so that it doesn't get in the way.
5. add a task scheduler entry so EKilitFucker runs on next logon.
6. sign out.
7. when the user logs back in immediately turn UAC back on and remove the task scheduler entry.
8. since E-Kilit is not running we are free to delete every goddamn file it has created. so we do just that ðŸ˜¯.
9. Voila! E-Kilit is no more!! you now can enjoy infinite amounts of boykisser pics on your school devices!!
